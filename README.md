## This is a working example for MySQL database, which accompanies the blog post "Testing Pessimistic Locking Handling with Spring Boot and JPA on Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL"

More examples here:
- [Example for Oracle](https://github.com/andistoev/testing-pessimistic-locking-handling-spring-boot-jpa-oracle)
- [Example for MySQL (this one)](https://github.com/andistoev/testing-pessimistic-locking-handling-spring-boot-jpa-mysql)
- [Example for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/andistoev/testing-pessimistic-locking-handling-spring-boot-jpa-postgresql)

### Intro
This SpringBoot maven project is part of my [blog post](https://blog.mimacom.com/testing-pessimistic-locking-handling-spring-boot-jpa/) where you could find not only explanation for it, but also theoretical background for:
- What does pessimistic locking handling mean
- How you could implement it within a Spring Boot Application and JPA on the Oralce, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases
- How you could write integration tests for handling pessimistic locking.

### Setup
- Install Docker and JDK8
- Start Oracle database container from docker/db-up.sh
- Check with "docker ps" if the container is up&running.

### Run pessimistic locking integration test withing in-memory database Apache Derby
ðŸ”” *Ideal for your DevOps pipeline*
- Switch profile in InventoryServicePessimisticLockingTest.java to "test" (the default one)
- Run "./mvnw clean verify".

### Run pessimistic locking integration test withing Oracle DB 
ðŸ”” *Ideal for quick local test to try the real database when changing the pessimistic locking handling code*
- Switch profile in InventoryServicePessimisticLockingTest.java to "test-oracle"
- Run "./mvnw clean verify".
