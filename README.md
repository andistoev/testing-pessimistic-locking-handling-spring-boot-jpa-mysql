# Source Code For Blog Post "Testing Pessimistic Locking Handling with Spring Boot and JPA on Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL"

## This example illustrates you how to implement it on the MySQL database with the help of in-memory Apache Derby database for testing

This SpringBoot maven project is part of [blog post](https://blog.mimacom.com/testing-pessimistic-locking-handling-spring-boot-jpa/) where you could find not only explanation for it, but also theoretical background for:
- What does pessimistic locking handling mean;
- How you could implement it within a Spring Boot Application and JPA on the Oralce, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases;
- How you could write integration tests for handling pessimistic locking.
